# Problem 1

Creating a data frame comprised of: a random sample of 8, a logical vector, a character vector, and a factor vector.

```{r df_1}
HW1_df = tibble(
  HW1_samp = rnorm(8),
  HW1_samp_pos = HW1_samp > 0,
  HW1_char = c("This","is","my","first","home","work","assignment","yay"),
  HW1_factor = factor(c("Kittens","are","cute","Kittens","are","cute","are","cute")),
)
```

Then trying to take the mean of each variable.

```{r df_1_means, collapse = TRUE}
 mean(pull(HW1_df, HW1_samp))
 mean(pull(HW1_df, HW1_samp_pos))
 mean(pull(HW1_df, HW1_char))
 mean(pull(HW1_df, HW1_factor))
```

What worked and what doesnâ€™t?
