# Problem 1

**Creating a data frame**

``` r
library(tidyverse)

HW1_df = tibble(
  HW1_samp = rnorm(8),
  HW1_samp_pos = HW1_samp > 0,
  HW1_char = c("This","is","my","first","home","work","assignment","yay"),
  HW1_factor = factor(c("Kittens","are","cute","Kittens","are","cute","are","cute")),
)
```

**Then trying to take the mean of each variable.**

``` r
mean(pull(HW1_df, HW1_samp))
## [1] -0.1557033
mean(pull(HW1_df, HW1_samp_pos))
## [1] 0.375
mean(pull(HW1_df, HW1_char))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(HW1_df, HW1_char)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
mean(pull(HW1_df, HW1_factor))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(HW1_df, HW1_factor)): argument is not numeric
## or logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
```

**What worked and what didnâ€™t?**

*I was not able to take the mean of the last 2 variables because they
were not numeric or logical vectors.*

**Applying the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor
variables**

``` r
as.numeric(pull(HW1_df, HW1_samp_pos))
as.numeric(pull(HW1_df, HW1_char))
as.numeric(pull(HW1_df, HW1_factor))
```

**What happens, and why?**

*The logical vector returned as numbers corresponding to TRUE or FALSE.
The character vector was unable to return numeric values and instead
returned NA. The factor vector returned numeric values although they
corresponded to the levels rather than the vector itself.*

# Problem 1.1

**In this code chunk we will:**

  - convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result
    to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result

<!-- end list -->

``` r
HW1_samp_num = as.numeric(pull(HW1_df, HW1_samp_pos))
HW1_samp_num * pull(HW1_df,HW1_samp)
## [1] 0.15841056 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.09724322
## [7] 0.00000000 1.04022145

HW1_samp_factor = as.factor(pull(HW1_df,HW1_samp_pos))
HW1_samp_factor * pull(HW1_df,HW1_samp)
## Warning in Ops.factor(HW1_samp_factor, pull(HW1_df, HW1_samp)): '*' not
## meaningful for factors
## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

HW1_samp_num2 = as.numeric(HW1_samp_factor)
HW1_samp_num2 * pull(HW1_df,HW1_samp)
## [1]  0.3168211 -0.5893597 -0.3083133 -0.7740897 -0.6373859  0.1944864
## [7] -0.2323527  2.0804429
```
